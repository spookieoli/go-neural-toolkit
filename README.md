# go-neural-toolkit
A neural toolkit for Go (Golang)

Project goals:

- create a general purpose and FAST neural toolkit
- create a Tensorflow/Keras like developer experience
- no dependencies - Go standard library only
- Pure GO - no C, RUST etc..
- Layers Dense, CNN, GRU, LSTM, etc. support
- in the (far..) future: interchangable models with Tensorflow/PyTorch
